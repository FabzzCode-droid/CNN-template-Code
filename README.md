# CNN-template-Code
This project is part of a 30-day hands-on AI learning challenge focused on intuition and practice, not complex math. The goal for Day 5 is to understand and implement the basics of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using the MNIST dataset â€” a collection of handwritten digits from 0 to 9.
